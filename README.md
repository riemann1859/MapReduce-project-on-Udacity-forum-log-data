**Tasks**:

1.) Find the busiest hour of each student in the forum. We have a lot of passionate students that bring a lot of value to forums. 
    Forums also sometimes need a watchful eye on them, to make sure that posts are tagged in a way that helps to find them, that 
    the tone on forums stays positive, and in general - they need people who can perform some management tasks - forum moderators. 
    These are usually chosen from students who already have shown that they are active and helpful forum participants. Our students 
    come from all around the world, so we need to know both at what times of day the activity is the highest, and to know which of 
    the students are active at that time.
